# Petshop

**A2 - OOP II / 2020.1<br/>
Universidade Veiga de Almeida<br/>
Information Systems course<br/>**

A very rudimental CRUD, created as a test for my Object-Oriented Programming course with Java, on college.

I used Swing as interface.  You can clone this project on your NetBeans workspace.

There is a lot of things that could be better in this project, it was made in a hurry (two days), to be honest I'm not proud of it, but it complied it's purpose very well at that moment.

I desire to rebuild this Petshop program in a much better e-commerce  thing with Python, soon as I can.
